# Clustering-Geolocation-Data-Intelligently
My learning outcomes and followup of a well instructed Coursera guided project by Ari Anastassiou.

We were provided with taxi rank location data of North American Region and had to solve a problem of defining the key clusters of these taxis where service stations for all taxis operating in that area can be built.

## Outcome
After completing this project I am able to do basic data manipulations required for any data processing field throughly and through various visual means.
Further I got a more deep insight on how various clustering algorithms differ from each other and how I can evaluate their strength on basis of various data.
Lastly this project provided a good insight to how some real world problems can be solved using these means.
